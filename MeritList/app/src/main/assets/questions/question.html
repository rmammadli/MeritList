<b>6.</b> A Youngâ€™s double slit interference arrangement with slits S1 and S2 is immersed in water (refractive index = 4/3) as shown in the figure. The positions of maxima on the surface of water are given by $x^2 = p^2m^2\lambda^2-d^2$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in air (refractive index = 1), 2d is the separation between the slits and m is an integer. The value of p is
